# SMART Implementation Prototype
Prototype implementation of Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART)

#### TODO
* store answers
* ~input validation [DONE until validating custom questions]~
* ~store subject's progress / config in db~
* ~incorporate subject ID? => keep from retaking survey (integration REDCap?)~
* ask your own question
* only 1 primary question?
* server-side validation
* keep from breaking (invalid study id, etc)
* show amazon code after survey
* ~log in~
* log out
* authenticate REDCap token (account for false studies)
